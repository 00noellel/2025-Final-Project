# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cozy Wardrobe (or something along the lines of that)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A minigame that lets you dress a character in different clothing items, along with a story that will give the player a chance to acquire new clothing in different ways. The closet will already have clothing items prepared, but through mini adventures, the player will be able to interact with the outside world and have the opportunity to expand the closet.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to try to use Godot, and see how I can use the engine to design the character and environemnt, as well as adding music. The (probably) sprite will be able to move around and pick up items, as well as go into the closet and scroll through the catalogue of clothes that they already own and put them on/switch clothes out. I also, if I can, plan to use text bubbles or some kind of story mode that will give a small storyline to the background of the game and introduce meeting other people/going new places to acquire new items. Maybe I will input a checklist of items needed within a period of time for the player to complete?

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to implement the character and main room environment, and at least get the closet up and going to scroll through some type of catalogue, even if only a couple of items are in there. I want to add music, and in general, be happy with the way the game looks and operates by the end, even if unfinished.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would include a small storyline, and would implement the adventure aspect that I want to strive for in the game, in moving to different places and interacting with new characters.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome possible for my final project would be a clean cut game that not only lets the player dress up, but expand their wardrobe by exploring the places around them outside of their room, meeting new people and finding new places to create a more complex storyline that includes new advancements in getting new, maybe rare, items of clothing to upgrade the closet.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

From a quick search, it seems like I need to look into GDScript, and figure out how to design my game. I need to research game design and how to actually implement the design in Godot, and after I have an idea of what I even want my game to look like, I'll go from there.
