Final Thoughts 

Overall, I'm very happy about how far I came in the game, because my learned curve was definitely a big obstacle I had to overcome through time and effort 
by watching many tutorials and reading many reddit threads. 

I enjoyed being able to design my own sprite, even if it's quite basic, and I also enjoyed being able to look at all the premade tilemaps that others have uploaded online. 

Although I didn't get too far into the actual game due to how long it took me to create the closet menu, I'm still glad I got to meet one of my goals, even if it isn't 
exactly how I imagined it would look.

Challenges: 
Getting used to using Godot, and learning the very basics of the trees and how scenes, sprites, and tiles work was a big mountain I had to climb, and from there a lot of 
other challenges still arose. I had a lot of trouble following tutorials because I wanted to tweak them and the layout of some of them so that I could make my game look
more similar to what I envision, which came with a load of errors and difficulties. Because it was my first time doing this, there were definitely things I probably missed 
that could have made the journey easier, but I'm still happy about how far I came. 
I combatted my challenges by watching tutorials on how to initally build a general game, and then broke off into tutorials more personalized to what I wanted. When I encountered obstacles
after that, I took to cross referencing multiple tutorials and going to google to look on websites like reddit and stack overflow for advice when people had similar problems. 
Random websites that taught me small fixes and details helped, as well. All in all, this was only possible because of the longer time frame given, so I could take the time to 
steadily make changes and correct errors. 

I also had trouble finding a true tutorial on the layout for the closet menu that fit my vision for the game, but I worked around that by finding a tutorial for something similar!

Another annoying obstacle was learning how to naviagte around Godot's strictness with spaces and tabs within scripts!!

I really enjoyed this project, as it taught me a lot of things about game developing, which is something I've been wanting to try. Now, I have a newfound respect for 
people who can create any type of game.
